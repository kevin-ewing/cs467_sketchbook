# CSCI0467 Sketchbook

Welcome to my generative art sketchbook repository! Here you will find a collection of sketches and experiments that I have created using various generative art techniques and programming languages.

Generative art is a form of art that involves using algorithms, rules, and randomness to create unique and complex visual designs. I have always been fascinated by this form of art, and this repository serves as a documentation of my journey into the world of generative art.

My goal with this repository is not only to document my own learning and experimentation, but also to share my work with the wider generative art community. I hope that these sketches can serve as inspiration for others who are interested in exploring this fascinating form of art.

Thank you for taking the time to explore my generative art sketchbook repository. I look forward to hearing your feedback and seeing the work that you create using these sketches as a starting point.
